  "summary": "TimelineView can takes in events and display events on a horizontal timeline",
  "description": "TimelineView uses UICollectionView and flowlayout to create an overall timeline for the app. Some special feature that you might not expect are 1. events will be drawn up and down when two events are close (less than 30 days difference) 2. the size of cells in UICollectionView is dynamically shaped because the intention is to create a gap between events to show time elapse. More implementation details can be found on the github readme. Enjoy!",
