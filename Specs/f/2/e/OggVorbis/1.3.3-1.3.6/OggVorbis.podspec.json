  "description": "Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond MPEG audio layer 3.\nUnlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.\nAll the technical details are published and documented, and any software entity may make full use of the format without license fee, royalty or patent concerns.\n---\nOgg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw, compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.\nFor example, the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media streams into a single physical bitstream.",
